Aegean numbers was the numeral system used by the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations. They are attested in several Aegean scripts ([BLOCK:linear-a Linear A], [BLOCK:linear-b-syllabary Linear B]). They may have survived in the Cypro-Minoan script where a single sign with "100" value is attested so far on a large clay tablet from Enkomi.
